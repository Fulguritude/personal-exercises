## Rationale:

(Written in 2023-02)

I was already a decent Python programmer at the time, but I did this series of exercises as a proofreading + beta test of the Python machine learning bootcamp created by 42-AI, as one of its longtime members. I've since learned a *lot* more about Python, and have now taken the habit to type-hint my code almost everywhere, and to style it in a way that makes type-hints neat and legible for collaborators.
