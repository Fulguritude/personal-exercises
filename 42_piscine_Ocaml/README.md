Amongst my various projects and activities, teaching programming is one of them. Woefully, through these efforts, I've noticed that functional programming, despite its capital importance in theoretical computer science and safe/secure software engineering, often gets the shortest straw. This is an attempt to rectify this.

I've already had a bunch of experience of OCaml from university (being the top performer in the subject amongst all students, and this experience has proven absolutely invaluable as I learned category theory and various other subjects linking math and CS in a deep manner), but it dates far back. Additionally, many people to whom I've taught programming, at least to some extent, are now looking for the "next step" in their evolution. So as I was setting [this](https://github.com/Fulguritude/code-discovery-exercises) up, I thought it would be a good idea to provide an OCaml section for it, since it is a "pure functional paradigm" language which is comparatively easy to get started with. Finally, since I want to start using more Scala in my work (as a data-centric software engineer), this refresher-plus-pedagogy seemed like a good step.
