## General description

This repo is somewhat of an archive of various CS/programming subjects I've learned, and a place I can refer to to refresh my mind when I'm helping students that are working on a similar bootcamp/project etc.

It can also serve as a go-to repo when I'm doing some new sort of bootcamp of this kind that I want to archive.

It could serve as a part of my software engineering portfolio, but this would require cleanup of many old exercises which is not really worth the time, given the more interesting things I can do with my experience (for example, I'm not going to type-hint some multi-year-old beginner Python exercises when I've written fully-typed "custom network protocol" clients in Python interfaced over C with ctypes, and full-on (proprietary) data engineering APIs, if you catch my drift).
